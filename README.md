# daily-expense-tracker-csv
This Python project logs daily expenses for each date in the current month. It prompts the user to enter multiple expenses for each day and saves them in a CSV file (data.csv) along with the date. The loop continues until the user types 0 to stop input for that day. At the end, it displays all the expenses entered and the total amount spent.
